                        <p>Hi, I'm Kevin Fields. I own a couple of manufacturing plants and I am looking for a good location to open a third. 
                            It needs to be a place outside a major city but still close enough to major transportation network. 
                            It would also need to be a place with plenty of skilled labor that I could hire. I want a place that I can truly invest in. 
                            Plus for a location close to outdoor recreation activities that I would enjoy. </p>

                        <p>Hi, I'm Natali LeGrange. I have spent several years working in the tech industry and am looking for a place to start my own business in data analytics. 
                            It would be a small business so I am looking for a cozy place to open up shop. 
                            Since I'm just starting out I'd like to be able to get plenty of financial incentives from the place that I end up. 
                            I also want a place that is growing and has plenty of new people to the community, like me.</p>
