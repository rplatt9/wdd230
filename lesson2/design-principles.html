            <p>Inductive Automation uses contrast very well. They utlize many different colors in their 
                site and no matter the background color or image the text is easy to read. In addition to the 
                foreground and background colors they also exemplify ccontrast through their font sizes and styles. 
                Your eyes are drawn quickly to the "Built For Everyone" text at the center of the page because 
                of its size. The sans serif font they use truly makes the text pop.</p>

            <h3>White Space</h3>
            <p>Backcountry</p>

            <img src="backcountry.PNG" alt="Backcountry Home Page">
            <p>Backcountry utilizes white space to break up the page and draw your eyes to certain parts. 
                The menu and search bars are clear places to go on the home page and the white block with 
                text (also good use of contrast) helps to break up the various images used. The white space also 
                helps to exemplify their snow sports theme.</p>

            <h3>Hick's Law</h3>
            <p>Netflix</p>
            <a href="http://www.netflix.com">www.netflix.com</a>
            <img class = 'last-image' src="netflix.PNG" alt="Netflix Home Page">
            <p>I think that Netflix did an excellent job of incorporating the ideas behind Hick's Law into their 
                home page. When you first visit Netflix you have three options. Sign in, sign up, or change the language. 
                The third option is not terribly relevant but the other two exemplify the company's (and most companies) 
                business goals--get people to pay for their service. There are other options as you scroll down but when you 
                first login the choices are limited so as to help you make a decision.</p>
